<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  First and foremost, I am a Christia. I am a Christian that fails a TON to be
  like Christ Jesus, my Savior. However, I am committd to be excellent at my
  job, whatever that may be. Whether that be a humble teller at a regional bank
  or a front end developer for a national bank. I will be one of the greatest
  front end developers in the world because I know God will hold me accountable
  for how well I do my job. Not only that, but since I am a Christian, I want to
  be known for excellent work because I want to represent the God I serve well.
  Soli Deo Gloria.

  Outside of my own personal convictions, I am 24 years old, I live in Northern
  Kentucky and I am surrounded by Bengals fans which is annoying to say the
  least. I am a Browns fan and I have came to terms with the fact that no matter
  how hard I try to escape this painful reality... I cannot do so. My heart
  wants what it wants and for some odd reason, it just wants to be a browns fan.
  Pray for me.

  I didn't really mean to go on a tangent there about football, but hey, I'm not
  taking it back. Outside of football, basketball is my main sport of choice. I
  am a huge nerd and I like to play Dungeons and Dragons at my friends parents
  house. I almost always play as a barbarian. It's simple, sweet, and if you
  play it right... O.P. as all get out. In all seriousness though, I am working
  hard on coding so I can provide for my wife and future children, Lord willing.
  We want to go down to single income so my beautiful wife, Jill can stay home
  and raise our children. The way I believe God intended it to be. I will work
  hard until this happens. Contra Mundum. Coram Deo.
