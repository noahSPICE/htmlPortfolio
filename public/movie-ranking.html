  This is obviously completely opinion based. There is no science behind this...
  HECK, I am mixing up half of the genres here. Is Rocky 4 an action movie or a
  drama? Who really knows? Is "Spiderverse" REALLY a kids movie? Probably not.
  Does "Up On Poppy Hill" count more as an anime or a romance because at its
  very core it is fundamentally both. Same with "Little Women", Romance or
  Drama? Doesn't Romance always have drama? Is there a clear delineation between
  the two? Maybe... but probably not. But in todays culture where everything is
  relative, does it really even matter? It may matter to you but not ONE DANG
  BIT to me. Why does it not matter, you ask? Because everything is relative. If
  you don't like that then the solution is simple... change the very fabric of
  todays societal culture. EASY PEASY. Have fun you relativistic LIME! Sleep
  well knowing that you, yes YOU, brought all this relativism to fruition.
